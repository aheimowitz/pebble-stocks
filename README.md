StockWatch
=============

This is a pebble project designed at hack princeton. It uses the Tradier API to look up stock information and display it to the user based on the stock symbols they defined in their settings

This app is designed to work on its own without a companion app (except for the officia pebble app for internet access)

Unfortunately we were unable to finish this app completly by the end of hack princeton, however we will continue to work on it and hope to have it finished for use soon!
